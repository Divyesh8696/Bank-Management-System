# Bank Management System (Java Project)

The **Bank Management System** is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to perform basic banking operations. It is designed to mimic the core functionality of a banking system, making it easier to manage multiple accounts and customer details using an interactive, menu-driven interface.  

This project demonstrates the use of **Java OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods, encapsulation)** along with fundamental programming techniques such as arrays/lists, loops, and sorting algorithms.

## Project Overview
Banks deal with customer records and financial transactions daily. Handling these tasks manually is tedious and error-prone. This project provides a digital solution to manage banking records efficiently, while also serving as a great learning exercise for Java beginners.  

The program allows customers to:  
- Create a new bank account with details such as name, account number, and initial balance.  
- Perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals.  
- Check account balances instantly.  
- View all customer details in an organized format.  
- Sort accounts (by account number, balance, or name depending on the implementation).

## Features
- Create Account – Add new customer records.  
- Deposit & Withdraw – Perform secure transactions.  
- Check Balance – View the current balance of any account.  
- View Customer Records – Display details of all accounts.  
- Sort Accounts – Arrange accounts for better record management.  
- Exit – Safely close the program.
